# Voronoi Mushroom Lamp Mode

This model improves the (original Voronoi Mushroom Lamp)[https://www.printables.com/model/165967-markellov-mushroom-lamp-2-with-e14-socket] by making the feet and the head screwable together.

This improves building/maintaining the lamp alot.

It uses the `mushroom_top.stl` from (this)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2899199/files] model by zikes.
For the feet use the model `Feet_E14.stl` from (this)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4761864] model by RolfZuckowskiUltras.

Print the `part_connector.stl` with fuzzy skin on the outside smooth wall, but not the threads!
You can glue the `part_connector.stl` into the `Feet_E14.stl`, the fuzzy skin makes it stick well. 
Now you can screw the `mushroom_top_screwable.stl` onto the newly created feet.

## LIMITATIONS
Currently the `mushroom_top_screwable.stl` cannot be generated by OpenSCAD due to weird STL issues.
Instead one should take the `part_connector.stl` and negative is against the base of the original `mushroom_top.stl`.
Additionally `mushroom_top.stl` had to be removed from the repo as its size exceeds Githubs limits.

Requires libs for OpenSCAD compilation:
- (threadlib by adrianschlatter)[https://github.com/adrianschlatter/threadlib] and its dependencies
